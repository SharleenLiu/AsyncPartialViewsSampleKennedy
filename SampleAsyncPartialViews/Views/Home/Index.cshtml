    Below are three sections. Initially they are all computed during the request. We are moving
    the slow ones to their own actions with partial views and loading them via JavaScript asynchronously.

<div class="news">
    <h3>News (slow)</h3>
    @Html.Partial("NewsControl", Model.NewsItems)
</div>
<div class="userDetails">
    <h3>Your Details</h3>
    @Html.Partial("DetailsControl", Model.UserDetails)
</div>
<div class="popular">
    <h3>Most Popular (slow)</h3>
    @Html.Partial("PopularControl", Model.MostPopular)
</div>
